# Datepicker-js
Forked from [Stefan Petre's](http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker/) and
[Eternicode's](https://github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker) work on bootstrap-datepicker.

This is the same datepicker plugin, but with less clutter and without bootstrap. It also integrates
well with Npm and Browserify.

## Why?
* Integrates well with npm/browserify


## Usage
    npm install datapicker-js
